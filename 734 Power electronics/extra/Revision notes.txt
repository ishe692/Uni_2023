Some revision of some concepts:

P = I^2*R = V^2/R = IrmsVrmscos(theta)
S = Irms*Vrms = Irms^2*Z = Vrms^2/Z
Q = Irms*Vrms*sin(theta) = Irms^2*X = Vrms^2/X

rms for duty cycle square wave: = A*sqrt(D)
average = A*D

rms for triangle wave: = A/sqrt(3)
average = A/2

rms for sin wave: = A/sqrt(2)
average = 2*A/pi

inverting transfer function = -R2/R1
non-inverting transfer function = 1+R2/R1

Low pass filter transfer function:

        wn^2
-------------------
s^2 + wn*s/Q + wn^2

Hz to rads:
f = w/2pi

some matlab code for transfer functions:

wn = 100;
Q = 10
top  = [1 wn^2];
bottom = [1 wn/Q wn^2];
sys = tf(top,bottom);
bode(sys)
pole(sys)

a capacitor and an inductor can cancel each other out through resonance
when the reactance of each is equal and opposite and they are in parrallel
resulting in a net 0 current through their branch. (180degree phase difference)
