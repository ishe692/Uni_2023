% Replace the following three sentences with your content
\textbf{What have you achieved in the past two weeks?}

%I have worked on the Web API interface over the last two weeks. My job was to send HTTP requests with the data from the scales to the web server. I have achieved the following tasks:

In the last two weeks, I have met my team and worked on a few beginning tasks. I have been appointed as leader and have delegated some roles and ensured the group is on task and going in the right direction. I have achieved the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}

\item Contributed to team charter and ensured agreement from everyone on the final charter.

\item Delegated roles to other team members such that we could improve specificity in our risk analysis by holding members accountable to manage certain risks. Ellen(team coordinator), Ojas(Software team lead), Angela(Compsys/Software cross team member), Enuri(Comsys team lead), William(Electrical/Compsys cross team member), Isaac(Electrical team lead). Shameer(Compsys team member), Joshua(Software team member)  

\item I have contributed to the risk analysis by writting two risk paragraphs along with kicking off the conversion to LaTex and deligating the software team to finish that off and submit it while the other team members attend Duleepas refresher tutorial.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are you planning to do in the next two weeks?}

%In the next two weeks, we plan to finish the web interface and ensure the data flow from end to end. I will work on the following tasks:
The next tasks to focus on for the next few weeks are planning possible designs, then writing and submitting a project proposal. I will work on the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Delegating the sub teams, Elect, Comp, Soft, to start designing and thinking about possible implementations to be submitted in the project proposal.

\item Work with William in exploring some possible implementations for the electrical hardware. Run some simulations and tests to validate chosen implementation.

\item Work with William to write the hardware section of the project proposal.


\end{itemize}

\textbf{What issues have you encountered?}

%The main issues have been with getting everything to work together. Some of our team members are busy with assignments for other courses and still need to build their parts. This means we can't see the data flowing from the scales to the web API yet. The worst person is Jack Doe, as we need him to finish the components for converting the electrical signal to a digital signal. Janet Doe will start to work with him to complete the parts.

%The web API is also causing problems. Jane Doe built the initial API, but the web server team changed the data requirements. I will need to change my code to match the new requirements. These changes are small, but I am worried that the web team will make more changes, and I will need to keep changing my code in response. This makes it very hard to say I'm done, as they changed their requirements three times.
A challenge we have faced so far are finding a meeting time that works with everyone outside of tutorial time. We settled on 11am on Tuesday which only Ojas cannot make but can attend via zoom.

The other challenge we have faced is submitting documents in LaTex, but we overcame this through asking chatGPT how to do this. We then set up an Overleaf then shared the link with everyone. Joshua then figured out how to configure the risk analysis.
