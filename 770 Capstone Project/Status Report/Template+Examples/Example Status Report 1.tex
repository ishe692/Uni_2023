\section*{Status report for \name{} [\upi]}

% Replace the following three sentences with your content
\textbf{What have you achieved in the past two weeks?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Our group met with our supervisor in both previous weeks. We have scheduled a weekly meeting Thursday at 11:15 am in the tutorial room. I was allocated to work on the software component of the project, which I'm most comfortable with. 

\item Our team started using MS Teams, so we can directly discuss the project.

\item We started investigating tools to implement the software endpoints. We considered Node.js with Express, Firebase Cloud Functions, and Python. We ended up selecting Firebase; as my group mates said, it's a quick and easy option. I'm not very familiar with it.

\item We also started investigating which database technology to use. We looked at MongoDB and Firebase Firestore. Again, we selected Firebase, as my group are familiar with it. I haven't used it before.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are you planning to do in the next two weeks?}

\begin{itemize}
\item We will start to implement both the software endpoints and database. Personally, I will spend some time getting familiar with Firebase, before we start to implement it. 

\item As a team, we need to produce the Team Charter, and Risk Analysis report. Both of these are due on March 10


\end{itemize}

\textbf{What issues have you encountered?}

\begin{itemize}

\item The main issue I've had is that I'm not familiar with Firebase, which we will use for the software endpoints. I have started playing around with it, and reading the documentation to become more comfortable with it.

\item Another minor challenge was getting to know my group. A couple of members had been difficult to contact, and didn't use the Teams channel for a while. But, that's resolved now, and everyone is responding to the group chat
